# Cool stuff learned during setup

* Select (a) line(s) of lua and press `: lua` to run the line
* Select a function and do the above step. Then you can call the function with `: lua funcName()`
* :terminal to open new buffer terminal

## Some stuff to build

* -- A way to run a spec file or adjacent spec file with a keybind, opening in a vim terminal or tmux pane --
* A way to quickly evaluate a line or few highlighted lines of js/ts code in a popup window with results
* A practice environment or file where I can practice new vim keybinds and stuff
* Change oil to show some useful hidden files
* Use treesitter inspect to figure out how we can override the syntax highlighting for typescript to make it more awesome in, for example, spec files

## Things we may want to get rid of:

* -- Telescope: Just use snacks --
* -- Whichkey: Once we get used to the keybinds --
* -- Noice: See if it's faster without --
*
